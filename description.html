Sometimes it's useful to download a shortcut to a web site as a file that can be saved in a folder on the local disk.

This add-on creates a cross-platform alternative to an shortcut such as a <code>.URL</code>, <code>.website</code>, or <code>.LNK</code> file (on Windows); a URL shortcut <code>.webloc</code> file (on Mac OS X); or a <code>Type=Link</code> desktop file (on Linux). The same HTML link file is compatible with multiple browsers and operating systems.

Click the "Generate a link" button to download and save a file that works as a link to the current page. This file ends with <code>.link.html</code>, but it does <em>not</em> save a copy of the current page. It's like a bookmark, but stored as an individual HTML stub file pointing to the desired URL.
