Just installed extension, seems like it works as expected, and nothing more :o)
One thing i had hoped for is a fixed save to location in setup, + an option for no confirmation would be nice. (button could turn green if link/file exists)

What i would us it for is sending / archiving links in dropbox/onedrive.

Even better a fixed save location + a list of identifier's (home, work, fun, games, archive). So your button works like a , listing home,work,.... (using the identifier name as name for subfolder) And one / no identifier = works without .
